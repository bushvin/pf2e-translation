I try to maintain the same structure as the [Pathfinder Second Edition Core Rulebook](https://paizo.com/products/btq01zp3):

`<category>/<item>/<2 letter language code>.scribe`

With:

**category**

- ancestries
- backgrounds
- classes
- skills
- feats
- spells

**item**

- human
- wizard
- arcane

**2 letter language code**

The 2 letter language code as per the [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) specification
